# Proxy: Easy Polymorphism in C++

[![Proxy-CI](https://github.com/microsoft/proxy/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/proxy/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml)

Do you want to facilitate lifetime management and maintenance of polymorphic objects in C++?

Do you want to be able to write polymorphic code in C++ as easily as in languages with GC (like Java or C#), while still having excellent runtime performance?

Have you tried other polymorphic programming libraries in C++ but found them deficient?

If so, this library is for you. ðŸ˜‰

The "proxy" is a single-header, cross-platform C++ library that Microsoft uses to make runtime polymorphism easier to implement and faster. Please find the design details at https://wg21.link/p0957.

## Quick start

The "proxy" is a header-only C++20 library. Once you set the language level of your compiler not earlier than C++20 and get the header file ([proxy.h](proxy.h)), you are all set. You can also install the library via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/), which is a C++ library manager invented by Microsoft, by searching for "proxy" (see [vcpkg.info](https://vcpkg.info/port/proxy)).

All the facilities of the library are defined in namespace `pro`. The 3 major class templates are `dispatch`, `facade` and `proxy`. Here is a demo showing how to use this library to implement runtime polymorphism in a different way from the traditional inheritance-based approach:

```cpp
// Abstraction
struct Draw : pro::dispatch<void(std::ostream&)> {
  template <class T>
  void operator()(const T& self, std::ostream& out) { self.Draw(out); }
};
struct Area : pro::dispatch<double()> {
  template <class T>
  double operator()(const T& self) { return self.Area(); }
};
struct DrawableFacade : pro::facade<Draw, Area> {};

// Implementation
class Rectangle {
 public:
  void Draw(std::ostream& out) const
      { out << "{Rectangle: width = " << width_ << ", height = " << height_ << "}"; }
  void SetWidth(double width) { width_ = width; }
  void SetHeight(double height) { height_ = height; }
  double Area() const { return width_ * height_; }

 private:
  double width_;
  double height_;
};

// Client - Consumer
std::string PrintDrawableToString(pro::proxy<DrawableFacade> p) {
  std::stringstream result;
  result << "shape = ";
  p.invoke<Draw>(result);
  result << ", area = " << p.invoke<Area>();
  return std::move(result).str();
}

// Client - Producer
pro::proxy<DrawableFacade> CreateRectangleAsDrawable(int width, int height) {
  Rectangle rect;
  rect.SetWidth(width);
  rect.SetHeight(height);
  return pro::make_proxy<DrawableFacade>(rect);
}
```

Please find more details and discussions in the spec. The complete version of the "drawable" demo could be found in [tests/proxy_integration_tests.cpp](tests/proxy_integration_tests.cpp) (also available on [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/5a3jeE1M8)).

## Minimum requirements for compilers

| Family | Minimum version | Required flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clang | 15.0.0 | -std=c++20 |
| gcc | 11.2 | -std=c++20 |
| MSVC | 19.30 | /std:c++20 |

## Use `proxy` with CMake and [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

See more details in [samples](./samples)

1. Set up vcpkg manifest
```
{
  "name": "<project_name>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "proxy"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Integrate `proxy` in CMakeLists.txt
```
find_package(proxy CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(<target_name> PRIVATE msft_proxy)
```

3. Run CMake with vcpkg toolchain file
```
cmake <source_dir> -B <build_dir> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg_dir>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

## Build and run tests with CMake

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/proxy.git
cd proxy
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build ./build -j8
cd ./build
ctest -j8
```
