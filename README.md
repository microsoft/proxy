# Proxy: Easy Polymorphism in C++

[![Proxy-CI](https://github.com/microsoft/proxy/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/proxy/actions/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml)

Do you want to save your effort in lifetime management and architecture maintenance of polymorphic objects in C++?

Do you want to be able to write polymorphic code in C++ as easily as in those languages with GC (like Java or C#), while still having excellent runtime performance?

Have you tried other polymorphic programming libraries in C++ but found them somewhat deficient?

If so, this library is for you. ðŸ˜‰

The "proxy" is a C++ library that Microsoft uses to make runtime polymorphism easier to implement, both in architecture design and runtime performance. Please find the design details at https://wg21.link/p0957.

## Build with CMake

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/proxy.git
cd proxy
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build ./build -j8
cd ./build
ctest -j8
```
