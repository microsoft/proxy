# Concept `facade`

```cpp
template <class F>
concept facade = /* see-below */;
```

The concept `facade<F>` specifies that a type `F` models a facade of [`proxy`](proxy/README.md). If `F` depends on an incomplete type, and its evaluation could yield a different result if that type were hypothetically completed, the behavior is undefined. `facade<F>` is `true` when `F` meets the [*ProBasicFacade* requirements](ProBasicFacade.md); otherwise, it is `false`.

Note that concept `facade` does not impose strong constraints on the dependent convention and reflection types. It is recommended to use [`facade_builder`](basic_facade_builder/README.md) to define a facade type that models concept `facade`.
